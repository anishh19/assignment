# Assignment

1. The assignment required me to create a web app using create-react-app to fetch dummy user data from an API and display it in a grid format.

2. I created two states in the app, one to store the state (Welcome, loading, success, and error) and one to store the userData after fetching it.

3. When the user presses a button, an async function is called that fetches the data.

4. The function uses the Fetch API to get the data and stores it in the state after fetching.

5. As soon as the button is pressed, the state of the app changes to loading.

6. The state then changes to success or error depending on the API call.

7. Everything is conditionally rendered according to the current state.

8. I have used Tailwind CSS for styling (Because that's what I usually work with on my projects). I am also comfortable with Custom CSS and Styled Components.
